# Twitch Word Ban
If a banned word is detected on a twitch channel chat some time will be added.

# How to run!

1. Download python and min.py and run

For obs:
1. Download python (personaly I use 3.11.5): https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a new terminal and enter the command """pyhton -m pip install flask"""
3. After that finishes you should now be able to go and run main.py (by default it will be set up to connect to the birnooce channel)
4. To add the countdown to obs add a new browser source with the url 127.0.0.1:8080
